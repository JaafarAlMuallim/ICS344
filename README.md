## Description

This project provides hands-on experience in offensive security, cyber deception using honeypots, security event correlation and analysis through Security Information and Event Management (SIEM), and
optionally defensive strategy formulation. Use a SIEM platform to collect and visualize data from both
the victim and honeypot environments. Set up an attacker-victim environment, compromise a specific
service, and replicate the attacks against a honeypot that mimics the service. Then, use a SIEM platform
to collect and visualize data from both the victim and honeypot environments.
